      <h2>Sensō-ji</h2><br>
      <p>While Tokyo may not boast as many temples as Kyoto, Sensō-ji has earned its title as the capital city's premier
        tourist hotspot for more than just being the default choice. What sets this attraction apart is its unique
        ambience that simply belongs on your must-visit list. Sensō-ji Temple itself, situated at the far end of a
        bustling shopping street, is a sight to behold. And if you happen to gaze to the left, you'll spot a recently
        renovated five-story pagoda, which proudly claims its status as Japan's second tallest pagoda. Surrounded by the
        temple's vicinity, you'll notice Japanese visitors gracefully circling a large cauldron positioned in front of
        the temple. This cauldron is no ordinary sight, it houses incense believed to grant blessings of good health to
        those who engage with it. Early birds who wish to dodge the tourist crowds should plan their visit accordingly,
        but even if you're only mildly intrigued by Japanese culture, Sensō-ji offers something for everyone to
        appreciate.

      <h2>Respect</h2><br>
      <p>When visiting Tokyo or any part of Japan, it's essential to embrace local customs and values. Respect for
        Japanese culture and its people is vital for a fulfilling and harmonious trip. Politeness and respect are highly
        regarded in Japan. When entering traditional places like homes or temples, remove your shoes to honour their
        cleanliness and significance. Bowing is a common form of greeting and respect, so a slight nod of the head when
        meeting people or expressing gratitude is appreciated. Learning a few basic Japanese phrases like "hello"
        (konnichiwa) and "thank you" (arigatou gozaimasu) can bridge cultural gaps and earn you goodwill. By
        understanding and respecting Japanese customs and etiquette, you'll not only enhance your travel experience but
        also gain a deeper appreciation for the culture. So, be courteous, open-minded, and considerate during your
        visit to this incredible city and country.
